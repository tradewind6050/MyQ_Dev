THESE ARE NOT FUNCTIONING DRIVERS

This is a repository of Smartthings Edge Drivers meant to connect and operate with MyQ as developed by an AI. 
The AI sometimes stops in the middle of a sentence or string of code, so some of these files might be incomplete. 

I do not have coding skills to start from scratch, but I wanted to see what an AI could develop. 

1.0.3 is the most recent file where I forced the AI to tell me when it was complete. There could be repetative strings and lines, but I have not read trhough it all line-by-line.  

If anyone can take this code and make it function, please, do! 

Just let me have it and publish it for all when you are done!
